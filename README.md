# DevNet Expert Studies
### Exam Date: TBD (Waiting for registration to open)

This repository will be used to track my progress and maintain all notes/scripts/apps developed during my Cisco DevNet Expert studies.
Along with labbing, I'll also be reading a few books to prepare for the DevNet Expert Lab exam. I am providing a list of the books I'm 
reading below, and will be checking them off as I knock them out. I'll also be using plenty of online resources and will try to include 
links to the resources I found most helpful along the way. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or have any additional 
feedback.

Book List:
- [x] Mastering Python Networking (Eric Chou)
- [ ] Network Programmability and Automation Fundamentals (Cisco Press)
- [ ] Network Programmability with YANG: The Structure of Network Automation with YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gNMI (Benoit Claise, Joe Clarke)
- [ ] Kubernetes: Up and Running: Dive into the Future of Infrastructure (Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower)
