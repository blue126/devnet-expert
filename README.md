This repository will be used to track my progress and maintain all notes/scripts/apps developed during my Cisco DevNet Expert studies.
Along with labbing, I'll also be reading a few books to prepare for the DevNet Expert Lab exam. I am providing a list of the books I'm 
reading below, and will be checking them off as I knock them out. I'll also be using plenty of online resources and will try to include 
links to the resources I found most helpful along the way. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or have any additional 
feedback.

## ATTENTION:
I've discovered that GitLab will most likely be used in the DevNet Expert lab environment, so I've begun developing some of my scripts/apps in a GitLab as practice. You can find the repo here: [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/dannywade/devnet-expert)
