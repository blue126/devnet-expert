This folder contains examples of two YANG modules. `ip-access-list.yang` is the "main" module, which is a data model that describes an Access Control List (ACL). The `protocol-base.yang` file is used to supplement, and is imported into `ip-access-list.yang`.

I hope this provides an example of what an NSO data model may look like. Obviously, there are other pieces to the puzzle, but this will help you get started creating YANG data models in NSO.
